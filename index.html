    <h2>1.	Act swiftly and decisively by implementing PHSMs</h2>

    <p>
      Experience shows that if PHSMs are implemented early and decisively, they can drastically reduce the severity of an epidemic by limiting shortages of hospital beds and other supplies, and ultimately saving lives. During the 1918 influenza pandemic, U.S. cities that implemented PHSMs early and thoroughly were able to “flatten the curve,” reducing the peak of their epidemics by up to 50%. Recent studies have shown that PHSMs implemented in Wuhan, China had significant impact. Had they been implemented one week, two weeks, or three weeks earlier, they would have further reduced the number of cases by 66%, 86% and 95%.

    <h3>Use the slider to change the start date of PHSM implementation in relation to the date of the first confirmed case.</h3>

    <p>
      Early implementation results in a flattening of the curve, whereas later implementation results in a high peak of transmission that can overwhelm health systems.

    <h2>2. “Stack” PHSMs to increase effectiveness</h2>

    <p>
      Although it is challenging to distinguish the effect of individual PHSMs on the rate of COVID-19 transmission, PHSMs are more effective when implemented in combination, or “stacked,” than when implemented individually.2,3  The effectiveness of a response also depends on how engaged communities are and how fully they can adopt and continue adhering to PHSMs over time, and other variables such as family size and level of intergenerational contact within a community. Initial stacking of PHSMs will allow for authorities to gradually lift interventions, which can diminish the economic and social costs.
