    <h2>1.	Act swiftly and decisively by implementing PHSMs</h2>

    <p>
      Experience shows that if PHSMs are implemented early and decisively, they can drastically reduce the severity of an epidemic by limiting shortages of hospital beds and other supplies, and ultimately saving lives.1,2 During the 1918 influenza pandemic, U.S. cities that implemented PHSMs early and thoroughly were able to “flatten the curve,” reducing the peak of their epidemics by up to 50%.2,3  Recent studies have shown that PHSMs implemented in Wuhan, China had significant impact.4 Had they been implemented one week, two weeks, or three weeks earlier, they would have further reduced the number of cases by 66%, 86% and 95%.

    <p>
      Early implementation results in a flattening of the curve, whereas later implementation results in a high peak of transmission that can overwhelm health systems.

    <h2>
      Stacking NPIs: An illustration.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is challenging to distinguish the effect of individual public health and social measures (PHSMs) on the rate of COVID-19 transmission within a population. Effectiveness depends on how fully communities adopt and adhere to PHSMs, additional interventions they are combined with, and other variables like family size and level of intergenerational contact within a community. Still, evidence does show that PHSMs are more effective when implemented in combination, or “stacked,” than when implemented individually. The following scenario illustrates this concept, when the PHSMs are tied to well-defined partitions of the general population.

    <p>
      The input model parameters come with a high degree of uncertainty, and model outputs are unstable with respect to variations in these parameters. Outputs should therefore be understood to illustrate the pattern of the infection — its surge and resurgence — rather than to provide reliable quantitative projections. A number of expected deaths is tallied at the end to demonstrate the impact of prolonged, high infection rates rather than momentary spikes. It is, in effect, a way to understand the area under the curve without additional lines on the chart.
